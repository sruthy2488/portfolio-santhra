        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m Dr. Santhra Babu, a dedicated doctor who’s as passionate about healing as I am 
            about coffee (the true fuel of a medical professional). </p>
        <p>I completed my MBBS at the prestigious Nicolae Testemitanu State University of Medicine
             and Pharmacy in Moldova, where I learned that saving lives requires both skill 
            and a sense of humor—because laughter is the best medicine, after all! </p>
        <p>When I’m not diagnosing or prescribing, you’ll find me reading up on the latest medical trends, 
            trying to master new languages (Moldovan was just the start), or debating with my friends about 
            whether pineapple belongs on pizza. </p>
        <p>I’m committed to delivering top-notch healthcare and constantly improving my knowledge to make sure 
            I’m providing the best care possible. </p>
        <p>So, if you’re in need of medical advice—or just a good conversation—I’m your go-to!</p>
